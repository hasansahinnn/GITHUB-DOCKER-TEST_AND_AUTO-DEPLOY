We will make our own CI/CD pipeline in this blog series. The work will do is in blog series;
Part 1 : Create Virtual Machine on Azure Portal and Install Docker
Part 2 : .Net Project and Docker File
Part 3 : Github Actions: Auto Test After Push Branch
Part 4 : Github Actions: Auto Publish to Docker Hub and Deploy Azure (SSH)
In short, when we push to Github, the new version of our application will be deployed on our server.
